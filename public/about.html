<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>You hit me with a cricket bat.</h2>
<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! </p>

<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. <b>I don't know why.</b> I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>

<h3>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</h3>
<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>

<li>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</li>
<li>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</li>
<li>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</li>

<p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</li>
<li>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</li>

<p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

<p>They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Saving the world with meals on wheels. Saving the world with meals on wheels. You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

<p>They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
</p>
<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
